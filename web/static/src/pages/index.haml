%h2 One Ruby <strong><a href="http://github.com/auser/pool-party/tree/master">Gem</a></strong> = easy EC2 computing cloud.

.tout
  %p.alt Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud provides pay-per-use scalability to the masses.  However, clouds do not have innate load-balancing ability, and there is no native failover solution.
  %p.alt PoolParty is an <strong>open source</strong> tool that <strong>automates</strong> deployment, monitoring, and load balancing of EC2 instances.  Configure once, and relax by the poolside -- PoolParty will keep your site and its instances afloat.
